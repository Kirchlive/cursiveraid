# Changelog

## v4.0.1 — 2026-03-11

Bugfixes, new display features, addon rename, and updated default profiles.

### Bug Fixes
- **Shadow Weaving: Mind Flay tracking** — Consecutive Mind Flay casts were cancelling each other's delayed scan events because they shared the same `ScheduleEvent` ID. Each scan now uses a unique ID via `GetTime()`.
- **Shadow Weaving: non-targeted mobs** — Shadow Weaving stacks were only updating on your current target because `ScanTargetForSharedDebuffs` was only called on `UNIT_AURA "target"`. Now `ScanForProcDebuff` triggers a full shared debuff scan immediately after queuing a new proc debuff, enabling stack/timer updates on all mobs.
- **Multicurse / isDarkHarvestReady nil error** — The `getEffectiveRefreshTime` function was moved above `pickTarget` (for multicurse to work) but its dependencies `isSpellOnCooldown` and `isDarkHarvestReady` were still defined later. Lua 5.0 requires top-down declaration order. All three functions are now in correct order.
- **Consecutive CAST proc scan cancellation** — The unique scan ID fix was only applied to CHANNEL events (Mind Flay). Now also applied to all CAST trigger events (Mind Blast, Shadow Bolt, etc.) for both foreign and own casts.

### New Features
- **Debuff Icon Spacing** — New slider (0–10, default 1) under Display > Layout to control the pixel gap between debuff icons. Previously hardcoded to 2.
- **Health Bar Spacing** — Renamed from "Spacing" for clarity.
- **Target Armor Position** — New slider (-30 to +30, default 0) under Display > Target Armor for horizontal offset of the armor display relative to its anchor point.

### Changes
- **Addon folder renamed: `Cursive` → `Cursive-Raid`** — TOC file renamed to match folder name (`Cursive-Raid.toc`). Users upgrading from v4.0 need to copy their SavedVariables files from `Cursive.lua` to `Cursive-Raid.lua` in both account and character WTF folders.
- **7 new default profiles** replacing the previous 12 class-specific ones: Default, Pro Full, Raid Debuff Tracker, Raid Live Armor View, Spy Enemy Player, Targeted Only Own Debuffs, Track All Near Friendly Player. Feature-focused rather than class-focused to inspire creative use.
- **Version bumped** to 4.0.1 in TOC, Options UI, and settings.

## v4.0 — 2026-03-08

The biggest update since the addon's creation. Complete UI overhaul, full profile system, and dozens of polish items across every aspect of the addon.

### New Features

#### Profile System
- **Save & Load profiles** — Snapshot your entire configuration and switch instantly
- **12 default profiles** — Raid Leader, Warlock, Warrior Tank, Mage, Healer, Rogue, Hunter, Priest, Compact, Wide, PvP, Druid
- **Export & Import** — Share profiles as text strings between players
- **Cross-character** — Profiles stored globally via `SavedVariables: CursiveProfiles`
- **Live refresh** — No `/reload` needed, all changes apply instantly
- **Minimap quickswitch** — Right-click the minimap icon for a profile selection menu
- **6th Options tab** — Full profile management UI (select, load, save, delete, save as new, export/import)
- **Scrollable dropdown** — Profile list dynamically sizes up to 16 visible entries, scrollable beyond that

#### Target Armor Display
- **Live armor monitoring** — Reads armor via `UnitResistance(GUID, 0)` without targeting
- **Build options** — Live + Total, Live + Reduced, Total + Reduced, or individual values
- **Color-coded** — Green → Yellow → Red as armor is stripped
- **Shield icon** — Configurable position (Left, Center, Right, None)
- **Position** — Anchored relative to raid icons with intelligent spacing
- **NPC-only** — Automatically hidden for player targets

#### Debuff Order Rewrite
- **Swap Side** — Categories can be moved to the opposite side of the bar
- **Per-category dropdowns** — Front, Mid, Rear, Last, Swap Side for each category (Own Class, Own Raid, Other Class, Other Raid)
- **Multiple categories per position** — Several categories can share Swap Side simultaneously

#### Options UI Overhaul
- **Decimal Duration dropdown** — None, White, or Red (replaces old checkbox)
- **Duration Timer / Stack Counter** — Added "None" option to hide completely
- **Debuff border system** — Per-category color coding (Own Class, Own Raid, Other Class, Other Raid)
- **Slider refinements** — Max Debuffs 18, Debuff Icon Size 30, Raid Icon Size 30
- **Armor section** — Enable toggle, Build dropdown, Position dropdown, Show Icon dropdown
- **Armor text size** — Separate slider (6-15)
- **Name text size** — Separate slider, independent from HP text size
- **HP formatting** — Clean display without decimals (110m, 440k, full number under 10k)

### Bug Fixes
- **Class Enable All button** — Fixed using wrong data key (`classDebuffKeys` → `classDebuffs`)
- **Test Overlay errors** — Added `UnitIsPlayer` wrapper and `IsTestGuid` guards in `curses.lua`
  - Fixed `CanApplyBleed`, `UpdateArmorCache`, `ScanGuidForCurse` for fake GUIDs
- **AceDB sentinel pattern** — Debuff order now persists correctly across sessions
- **Winter's Chill** — Apostrophe in normalization fixed
- **Sunder/EA exclusivity** — Bidirectional replacement (EA removes Sunder, Sunder removes EA)
- **Expose Armor** — Targetless CP detection via armor-diff now fully reliable

### UI Polish
- Display checkbox reorder: Health Bar → Unit Name → Raid Icons → Invert Bar Layout → Reverse Bars Upwards → Always Show Current Target
- Removed checkboxes: Show Targeting Arrow, Colored Decimal Duration (replaced by dropdown)
- Renamed labels throughout for clarity and consistency
- "Cursive" title above bars permanently removed
- Profiles info text removed for cleaner look
- Pixel-perfect spacing across all 6 tabs
- Dynamic raid order icon grid (auto-shrink at 14+ icons)

### Technical
- Profile serialization via `loadstring()` + `setfenv()` sandbox (pfUI-proven pattern)
- `raidDebuffOrder` auto-repair on profile load (missing keys appended, unknown keys removed)
- `shareddebuffs` patch on load (keys not in profile set to `false`)
- `DeepCopy` without metatables for clean snapshots
- New files: `profiles.lua` (385 lines), `profilesUI.lua` (733 lines), `defaultProfiles.lua` (439 lines)
